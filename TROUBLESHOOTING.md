# Troubleshooting Guide: Arduino Inverter

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

### 1. Low Output Voltage Issue
During testing, the inverter output was measured at 61.0V AC instead of the expected 220V AC. Here's a detailed analysis of potential causes and solutions:

#### a) Transformer Issues
- **Problem**: Incorrect turns ratio in the transformer
- **Solution**: 
  - Use a transformer specifically designed for inverter applications
  - Verify the turns ratio (should be approximately 18.33:1 for 12V to 220V conversion)
  - Consider using a higher-quality transformer with better core material

#### b) Transistor Performance
- **Problem**: Insufficient transistor saturation
- **Solution**:
  - Use higher-rated transistors (e.g., TIP31C/TIP32C pairs)
  - Ensure proper base current for full saturation
  - Add heat sinks to prevent thermal issues affecting performance

#### c) Power Supply
- **Problem**: Unstable or insufficient input voltage
- **Solution**:
  - Use a regulated 12V power supply
  - Add larger filtering capacitors (>1000ÂµF)
  - Use thick wires to minimize voltage drop

#### d) Load-Related Issues
- **Problem**: Voltage drop under load
- **Solution**:
  - Start with no load testing
  - Gradually increase load while monitoring voltage
  - Use appropriate gauge wires for the current
  - Consider soft-start implementation

#### e) Capacitor Problems
- **Problem**: Improper capacitor functioning
- **Solution**:
  - Use high-quality capacitors rated for switching applications
  - Verify correct polarity
  - Consider using snubber circuits
  - Use capacitors with low ESR

#### f) Connection Issues
- **Problem**: Poor electrical connections
- **Solution**:
  - Use proper soldering techniques
  - Implement proper wire termination
  - Regular maintenance and inspection
  - Use terminal blocks for secure connections
